# cynosure_study

**Welcome to the Cynosure study!**
We ask that you use this project, along with any analytical/visualization tools you are most comfortable with to gain insights on the data analysis being performed in *<ex>.ipynb*. 

The original datasets are: AB_NYC_2019.csv and hfi_cc_2020.csv
The original analysis was conduncted in notebooks: AB_analysis.ipynb and HFI_analysis.ipynb

The meta-data for these analysis are contained in: AB_meta-data.json and HFI_meta-data.json respectively.
Explore the example *meta-data-<>.json* files to start your meta-data analysis. 
The meta-analysis.ipynb is a helpful template to get you started. 
Documentation on the meta-data can be found there. Supporting code is presented in the Python programming language. We specifically leverage `Pandas DataFrames`. Visualizations are build with the `Altair` suite of libraries. 

While you are performing your analysis, keep in mind of the following questions: 
- Over what period of time did the analyst perform the analysis? 
- What is the objective of their analysis? 
- What attributes did they examine, transform and clean over time? 
- What deadend analytical techniques did they try? What techniques did they discard or ultimately keep? 
- How did they validate their results? 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding these questions, the task at hand or the tools we have provided you, please contact Deepthi: draghun1@umd.edu
We look forward to your feedback!
