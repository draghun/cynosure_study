# Cynosure Study

**Welcome to the Cynosure study!**

## DIRECTIONS FOR THE INTERVIEW
In order to ensure that you've created the necessary python environment, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root directory of this project where it is install on your local machine. This will automatically install Jupyter Lab and the required libraries if it's not already available. 

Once you have all these installed. Read through the meta-analysis.ipynb file in order to understand the meta-data. 
All this will prepare you for the interview. 

We ask that you use this project, along with any analytical/visualization tools you are most comfortable with to gain insights on the data analysis being performed in *<ex>.ipynb*. 

## EXPLANATION OF FILES
The original datasets are: AB_NYC_2019.csv and hfi_cc_2020.csv
The original analysis was conduncted in notebooks: AB_analysis.ipynb and HFI_analysis.ipynb

The meta-data for these analysis are contained in: AB_meta-data.json and HFI_meta-data.json respectively.
Explore the example *meta-data-<>.json* files to start your meta-data analysis. 
The meta-analysis.ipynb is a helpful template to get you started. 
Documentation on the meta-data can be found there. Supporting code is presented in the Python programming language. We specifically leverage `Pandas DataFrames`. Visualizations are build with the `Altair` suite of libraries. 

While you are performing your analysis, keep in mind of the following questions: 
- Over what period of time did the analyst perform the analysis? 
- What is the objective of their analysis? 
- What attributes did they examine, transform and clean over time? 
- What deadend analytical techniques did they try? What techniques did they discard or ultimately keep? 
- How did they validate their results? 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding these questions, the task at hand or the tools we have provided you, please contact Deepthi: draghun1@umd.edu
We look forward to your feedback!
